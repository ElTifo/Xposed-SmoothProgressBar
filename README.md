Module Description:

This module allows android users, that already have rovo89's Xposed framework (https://github.com/rovo89) available on their equipment, to replace android's default Indeterminate Progress Bars by a fully customizable ones.

The original module is available here -> https://github.com/MohammadAG/Xposed-SmoothProgressBar

My goal was to update this module to include the new features available on castorflex's libraries (circular progress bar for e.g.).
